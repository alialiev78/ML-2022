This repository contains completed assignments from a machine learning course. For the last homeworks, I partially completed them and instead contributed to a project focused on predicting player valuations based on data scraped from Transfermarkt (all of which was implemented as a Telegram bot). My role in the project involved web scraping and data cleaning, which can be found in the file **ML_bot.ipynb**.
